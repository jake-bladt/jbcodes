        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

        <p class="bio-summary">
        A full-stack, cross-platform technologist, I can bring a website or application from concept to completion.
        I have twenty years of experience as a hands-on developer, architect, technical leader, and devops engineer.
        I even do a bit of design as needed.

        <h2>What Will I Do Next?</h2>

        <p class="goals">
        My ultimate goal as a software developer is to improve the quality of life for the most people by the largest amount possible.
        When it's been feasible, I've done this through my choice of employer, working in med-tech, ed-tech, medical imaging, and medical transport. I've chosen my volunteerism the same way - focusing on projects that make it easier for people to volunteer more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p class="goals">
        For the last several years, I've been looking towards making a major contribution to the problem of clean and potable water -
        an issue that is tractable, can yield to better informatics, and can make a huge difference in the lives of people who currently do without. Towards that aim, I've been filling in the gaps in my skillset that I would need to run a project from concept to
        completion on commodity hardware and at the lowest reasonable cost.
        </p>

        <p class="goals">
        I'm not currently looking for a new job. The company I'm at is doing good work and improving people's lives. I'm doing automation and DevOps, which fills a soft spot in my previous experience. Hopefully, this will be the last job I ever need. I still want to improve my skills at UI/UX and design, but I can do that on my own time.
        </p>

        <p class="goals">
